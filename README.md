# Civil-7453-Project1-Photogrammetric-Stereo
The OSU civil department 7453 Homework, lectured by Dr.Qin(Rongjun Qin)
This class is concentrating on the cross study in Photogrammetry and Computer Vision.
Class content focus on the fundamental background in Computer Vision and Photogrammetry.
All files wil go to public with the authority from Dr.Qin   


Project1
Photometric stereo is a technique to recover local surface orientations, i.e. surface
normals, from images under different illumination conditions. In this project, you will be
given multiple images of an object captured under different directional illuminations and
the same viewpoint. Your program should be able to calibrate the illumination direction,
estimate the surface normal direction at every pixel. All the given images are linearlized,
i.e. the pixel value is the irradiance.
There are mainly two steps:
1. Calibration of illumination and direction and intensity
2. Estimation of Normals 

Environment: Visual Studio 15 Community  
Pre-install Package: Opencv2.4.13  


A brief report will cover background concepts of this project in Porj1 report.
